<h1> About Me </h1>
	<p>I was Born on November 24 2000. At Tracy California. I lived there for the first 9 in a half years of my life. In August of 2010 I moved to Clovis California. I've lived there ever since. Currently other than CART I go too Buchanan High School. I joined this place because well. Ever since I was a little kid I've loved to play Video Games (especially Pokemon Games), as well as looking stuff up on the internet. I wanted to learn how to use coding to learn how to make my own games and/or make a cool thing with it. That is why I am here at CART. Too learn how to do this stuff.
