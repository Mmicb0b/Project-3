	Most of the assignments I did required. Writing. Most of the Showcase Website was based off of a book writen by Matt Investern known as lol...OMG!. It's how I got the ideas for some of my digital responsibility stuff!, I also read a book called Ready Player One, by Ernest Clive. One other thing I think I may have wanted to do is become a writer. So I think looking up stuff for What I may or may not do in the future. Creativity is important.
