<h1>Photoshop</h1>
<body>
	<p>I like using Photoshop but that's mostly for entertainment purposes. However I have used it quite a lot at school for the African Wilddogs website and the Showcase website. That's basically it. so enjoy some of my photo edits so it would fit the website properly or something. It's creative to an extent kinda. It enabled me to make this. <img src=images/took%20me%202%20years%20but%20I%20FINALLY%20DID%20IT.jpg> </p>
