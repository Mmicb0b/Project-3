		Some of the things I have done in CART are Web Projects. I've done various Web Projects. The two Most Notable ones where the African Wild Dogs endangered Species Project, and the CART Showcase 2018 Website. Both of these are Collaberations but the One I am the most proud of was the Ideal Winter Break Project which you can see here (insert tag here). I'm proud of this one because I didn't need any help at all with this one.
		
		The African Wilddog project was with a partner, it was a multi week project where a classmate and I made a website with awareness on African Wild Dogs which you can see here, (insert tag here). I'm proud of this one because I stood up, took charge, and was a leader for the project. I felt very proud of my self for that.
		
		The Showcase Project. I collaberated with 2 classmates to make the website you see here <http://cartwebapp.com/student17/showcase/am/>. I am proud of this one because I learned how to properly use CSS a coding software I didn't know how to use properly prior to it. That and my family finally could see my work due to it being presented at showcase.
