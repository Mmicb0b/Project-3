<h2>3-23-18</h2>
				
<p> Dear Industry professionals: 

My Name is Matthew Brown. I was born on 11-24-2000 at Tracy California at the Tracy hospital. I am currently a 17 year old junior at Buchanan High School, and the Center of Advanced Research and Technology. I wish to practice my Computer Skills so I can work on Movies/TV Shows and/or make games when I grow up.

I grew up in a small town called Tracy and moved here to Clovis right before entering 4th Grade. I’d like to graduate High School and attend a 4 year University to learn how to become a TV Show/Film writer, and/or a Game Designer. I took a Game Design class at Bitwise last summer. I also used to do Swim Club and some other sports. I mostly spend my time going on the Internet and looking up new ideas for what I should do on my games and what not. In My Spare time I like to play Video Games I play a game on PC Called Overwatch. I also use my Switch quite often to play games on that too. I also spend a lot of time in Social Media chatrooms. This is my Linked in Page:https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-brown-987b5015a/
There are many different projects listed here. I’d recommend looking at my (insert my recommended idea here). 
Please feel free to look around to see the work that is waiting to be seen. Thank you for choosing this website and your time 

																					Sincerely,
																					Matthew Brown
